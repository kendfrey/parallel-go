	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		Once both players pass and the game is over, the board enters counting mode.
		From here, either player can mark dead stones or resume the game.
		Click on a group of stones to mark them as dead or alive.
	</p>
	<h1>Rules</h1>
	<p>
		Parallel Go is a variant of Go where players choose moves simultaneously.
		On each turn, once both players have selected a move, the moves are played together.
		The game ends when both players pass simultaneously.
	</p>
	<h2>Illegal Moves</h2>
	<p>
		Each player's move must be a legal move in its own.
		A non-passing move must place a stone on an empty intersection of the board, and the stone must end with at least one liberty.
		Taking a ko is allowed, and suicide is not allowed. Passing is always allowed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The two moves selected must commute with each other. That is, the order in which they are played should not affect the outcome.
		If the selected moves conflict in any way, both players must select a different move.
	</p>
	<p>
		If multiple conflicts happen during a single turn, every move is prohibited from being repeated until the next turn.
		Points prohibited to black are marked with a black X, to white with a white X, and to both with a gray X.
	</p>
	<p>
		The simplest conflict is two players attempting to play the same intersection.
		Other conflicts are possible, such as both players throwing in to start the same ko, or a capturing race that ends with both groups in atari.
	</p>
	<h2>Superko</h2>
	<p>
		No ko rule is necessary in Parallel Go, because moves are not sequential.
		It's still possible to repeat positions, so a superko rule is added to prevent repetition.
	</p>
	<p>
		No turn can repeat a board position.
		If the selected moves would repeat a previous position, they are treated as a conflict (prohibited until the next turn).
	</p>
	<p>
		The superko rule applies even if one player passes.
		The player who placed a stone is prohibited from selecting that move again.
		The player who passed is not prohibited from passing again or making any legal move.
	</p>
	<h2>Scoring</h2>
	<p>
		This game is scored using a Chinese style.
		Players receive one point for each living stone and one point for each surrounded intersection of territory.
		Eyes in seki do score points. Intersections not completely surrounded by a single colour score no points.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since neither player plays first, there is no komi. Because of this, draws are possible.
